<li>
<p>
	  On servers configured to perform DNSSEC validation using
	  managed trust anchors (i.e., keys configured explicitly
	  via <span><strong class="command">managed-keys</strong></span>, or implicitly 
	  via <span><strong class="command">dnssec-validation auto;</strong></span> or
	  <span><strong class="command">dnssec-lookaside auto;</strong></span>), revoking
	  a trust anchor and sending a new untrusted replacement
	  could cause <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span> to crash with an
	  assertion failure. This could occur in the event of a
	  botched key rollover, or potentially as a result of a
	  deliberate attack if the attacker was in position to
	  monitor the victim's DNS traffic.
	</p>
<p>
	  This flaw was discovered by Jan-Piet Mens, and is
	  disclosed in CVE-2015-1349. [RT #38344]
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	  A flaw in delegation handling could be exploited to put
	  <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span> into an infinite loop, in which
	  each lookup of a name server triggered additional lookups
	  of more name servers.  This has been addressed by placing
	  limits on the number of levels of recursion
	  <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span> will allow (default 7), and
	  on the number of queries that it will send before
	  terminating a recursive query (default 50).
	</p>
<p>
	  The recursion depth limit is configured via the
	  <code class="option">max-recursion-depth</code> option, and the query limit
	  via the <code class="option">max-recursion-queries</code> option.
	</p>
<p>
	  The flaw was discovered by Florian Maury of ANSSI, and is
	  disclosed in CVE-2014-8500. [RT #37580]
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	  Two separate problems were identified in BIND's GeoIP code that
	  could lead to an assertion failure. One was triggered by use of
	  both IPv4 and IPv6 address families, the other by referencing
	  a GeoIP database in <code class="filename">named.conf</code> which was
	  not installed. Both are covered by CVE-2014-8680. [RT #37672]
	  [RT #37679]
	</p>
<p>
	  A less serious security flaw was also found in GeoIP: changes
	  to the <span><strong class="command">geoip-directory</strong></span> option in
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code> were ignored when running
	  <span><strong class="command">rndc reconfig</strong></span>. In theory, this could allow
	  <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span> to allow access to unintended clients.
	</p>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>
	  ACLs containing <span><strong class="command">geoip asnum</strong></span> elements were
	  not correctly matched unless the full organization name was
	  specified in the ACL (as in
	  <span><strong class="command">geoip asnum "AS1234 Example, Inc.";</strong></span>).
	  They can now match against the AS number alone (as in
	  <span><strong class="command">geoip asnum "AS1234";</strong></span>).
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          When using native PKCS#11 cryptography (i.e.,
          <span><strong class="command">configure --enable-native-pkcs11</strong></span>) HSM PINs
          of up to 256 characters can now be used.
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          NXDOMAIN responses to queries of type DS are now cached separately
          from those for other types. This helps when using "grafted" zones
          of type forward, for which the parent zone does not contain a
          delegation, such as local top-level domains.  Previously a query
          of type DS for such a zone could cause the zone apex to be cached
          as NXDOMAIN, blocking all subsequent queries.  (Note: This
          change is only helpful when DNSSEC validation is not enabled.
          "Grafted" zones without a delegation in the parent are not a
          recommended configuration.)
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          NOTIFY messages that are sent because a zone has been updated
          are now given priority above NOTIFY messages that were scheduled
          when the server started up. This should mitigate delays in zone
          propagation when servers are restarted frequently.
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          Errors reported when running <span><strong class="command">rndc addzone</strong></span>
          (e.g., when a zone file cannot be loaded) have been clarified
          to make it easier to diagnose problems.
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  Added support for OPENPGPKEY type.
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  When encountering an authoritative name server whose name is
	  an alias pointing to another name, the resolver treats
	  this as an error and skips to the next server. Previously
	  this happened silently; now the error will be logged to
	  the newly-created "cname" log category.
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  If named is not configured to validate the answer then
	  allow fallback to plain DNS on timeout even when we know
	  the server supports EDNS.  This will allow the server to
	  potentially resolve signed queries when TCP is being
	  blocked.

<li><p>
	  <span><strong class="command">dig</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">host</strong></span> and
	  <span><strong class="command">nslookup</strong></span> aborted when encountering
	  a name which, after appending search list elements,
	  exceeded 255 bytes. Such names are now skipped, but
	  processing of other names will continue. [RT #36892]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  The error message generated when
	  <span><strong class="command">named-checkzone</strong></span> or
	  <span><strong class="command">named-checkconf -z</strong></span> encounters a
	  <code class="option">$TTL</code> directive without a value has
	  been clarified. [RT #37138]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  Semicolon characters (;) included in TXT records were
	  incorrectly escaped with a backslash when the record was
	  displayed as text. This is actually only necessary when there
	  are no quotation marks. [RT #37159]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  When files opened for writing by <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span>,
	  such as zone journal files, were referenced more than once
	  in <code class="filename">named.conf</code>, it could lead to file
	  corruption as multiple threads wrote to the same file. This
	  is now detected when loading <code class="filename">named.conf</code>
	  and reported as an error. [RT #37172]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">dnssec-keygen -S</strong></span> failed to generate successor
          keys for some algorithm types (including ECDSA and GOST) due to
          a difference in the content of private key files. This has been
          corrected. [RT #37183]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          UPDATE messages that arrived too soon after
          an <span><strong class="command">rndc thaw</strong></span> could be lost. [RT #37233]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          Forwarding of UPDATE messages did not work when they were
          signed with SIG(0); they resulted in a BADSIG response code.
          [RT #37216]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
          When checking for updates to trust anchors listed in
          <code class="option">managed-keys</code>, <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span>
          now revalidates keys based on the current set of
          active trust anchors, without relying on any cached
          record of previous validation. [RT #37506]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  Large-system tuning
	  (<span><strong class="command">configure --with-tuning=large</strong></span>) caused
	  problems on some platforms by setting a socket receive
	  buffer size that was too large.  This is now detected and
	  corrected at run time. [RT #37187]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  When NXDOMAIN redirection is in use, queries for a name
	  that is present in the redirection zone but a type that
	  is not present will now return NOERROR instead of NXDOMAIN.
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  When a zone contained a delegation to an IPv6 name server
	  but not an IPv4 name server, it was possible for a memory
	  reference to be left un-freed. This caused an assertion
	  failure on server shutdown, but was otherwise harmless.
	  [RT #37796]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  Due to an inadvertent removal of code in the previous
	  release, when <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span> encountered an
	  authoritative name server which dropped all EDNS queries,
	  it did not always try plain DNS. This has been corrected.
	  [RT #37965]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  A regression caused nsupdate to use the default recursive servers
	  rather than the SOA MNAME server when sending the UPDATE.
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  Adjusted max-recursion-queries to accommodate the smaller
	  initial packet sizes used in BIND 9.10 and higher when
	  contacting authoritative servers for the first time.
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  Built-in "empty" zones did not correctly inherit the
	  "allow-transfer" ACL from the options or view. [RT #38310]
        </p></li>
<li><p>
	  Two leaks were fixed that could cause <span><strong class="command">named</strong></span>
	  processes to grow to very large sizes. [RT #38454]
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  Fixed some bugs in RFC 5011 trust anchor management,
	  including a memory leak and a possible loss of state
	  information.[RT #38458]
