<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>If you haven't already read chapter 1 of K&amp;R, now would be a good time to
do so.  Also skim chapter 5, concentrating on the material on arrays (as
opposed to pointers, which we'll get to later).</p>
-->

<hr>

<h2>Arrays in C</h2>

<p>Arrays in C are declared as follows:</p>

<pre>    int foo[10];  /* Declares an array called 'foo' with space for ten ints. */
</pre>

<p>and accessed as follows:</p>

<pre>    int i;

    ...

    i = foo[4];  /* This gets the element from 'foo' at index 4. */
</pre>

<p>Note that arrays in C start at element 0, <i>not</i> element 1.
Therefore, in this case, the last element in the array would be
<code>foo[9]</code>.  Note also that array elements are not initialized to be
anything, so they should be assumed to hold garbage until you assign a value
to them.  Also, you need to realize that if you try to access an element "off
the end" of the array (<i>e.g.</i> the 100th element of the ten-element array
<code>foo</code> in the code above), you will get no compiler warnings, but
you'll probably get a core dump when the program runs.  This is part of C's
no-error-checking I-assume-you-know-what-you-want philosophy of
programming.</p>

<p>Arrays can also be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, etc.  The syntax is
analogous:</p>

<pre>    int foo[10][5];
    int i;

    ...

    i = foo[4][2];
</pre>

<p>In addition, arrays can be <i>initialized</i> when they are declared:</p>

<pre>    int foo[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    int bar[2][3] =
    {
      { 1, 2, 3 },
      { 4, 5, 6 }
    };
</pre>

<p>You will need to use array initialization in the next lab.  Finally,
you can pass arrays to a function like you would pass a normal variable:</p>

<pre>    void munge(int array[])
    {
       /* code that uses the values in array[] */
    }

    /* more code... */

    int main(void)
    {
        int stuff[10];

        /* more code... */

        /* Pass the 'stuff' array to the function 'munge'. */
        munge(stuff);

        /* etc. */
    }
</pre>

<p>However, when you do this, you should be aware that you are <i>not</i>
passing a copy of the array to the function but the array itself.  That means
that if you modify the array in the function it will remain modified when you
return from the function.  This will be useful in the assignment below.  The
reason for this behavior is due to the fact that C arrays are actually
represented as pointers; we'll cover this in later lectures and
assignments.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Program to write</h2>

<p>Write a program called <code>sorter</code> which behaves as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>If there are no command-line arguments at all when the program is run,
the program should print out instructions on its use (a "usage message"; see
<a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/cmdline_args.html">this page</a>).  There should only be one
usage message, and it must follow the standard conventions (see the previous
link).  Note that the optional command-line arguments (see below) must be
included as part of the usage message.</p></li>

<li><p>The program will be able to accept up to 32 numbers (integers) on the
command line.</p></li>

<li><p>If there are more than 32 numbers on the command line, or no numbers
at all, the program should print out the usage message and exit.</p></li>

<li><p>If the optional command-line arguments "<code>-b</code>" or
"<code>-q</code>" are found <b>anywhere</b> in the command line, change the
behavior of the program as described below.</p></li>

<li><p>If any of the command-line arguments to the program are not integers
or one of the two optional command-line arguments, your program's response is
undefined -- it can do anything.  (<i>i.e.</i> you shouldn't worry about
having to handle anything but integer arguments or the two command-line
options).  The way to deal with this is as follows: for each argument, first
check to see if it's one of the command-line options.  If so, proceed
accordingly.  If not, assume it represents an integer and convert it using
the <code>atoi()</code> function (see below).</p></li>

<li><p>Sort the numbers using either the minimum element sort or the bubble
sort algorithm (see below).  <b>Do not use a global array to hold the
integers</b>; use a locally-defined array in <code>main</code> and pass the
array to the sorting function.  Define separate functions for both sorting
algorithms.  Use <code>assert</code> (see below) to check your sorting
function for correctness.</p></li>

<li><p>Print out the numbers from smallest to largest, one per line.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>The Sample Output</h3>

<p>If the above doesn't make sense, this is what your program should look
like (bold is what you would type, and % is the Unix prompt):</p>

<pre>    % <b>sorter 5 9 -2 150 -95 23 2 5 80</b>
    -95
    -2
    2
    5
    5
    9
    23
    80
    150
    % <b>sorter</b>
    usage: sorter [-b] [-q] number1 [number2 ... ] (maximum 32 numbers)
    %
</pre>

<h3>Command-line arguments</h3>

<p>Your program begins in the <code>main</code> function, which up until now
has looked like this:</p>

<pre>    int main(void)
    {
       /* your code here */
       return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>but will now look like this:</p>

<pre>    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
       /* your code here */
       return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>So let's take the first line apart.  There are a few parts to this:</p>

<dl>

<dt><b><code>int</code></b></dt>
<dd><p>Declares that this function returns an integer.</p></dd>

<dt><b><code>main</code></b></dt>
<dd><p>Declares this function's name, <code>main</code>.  Recall that C
programs always begin executing in the <code>main</code> function.</p></dd>

<dt><b><code>int argc</code></b></dt>
<dd><p><code>argc</code> is equal to the number of elements of
<code>argv</code>.</p></dd>

<dt><b><code>char *argv[]</code></b></dt> <dd><p>Okay, this one's a bit
trickier.  The second argument, <code>argv</code>, is an array of "<code>char
*</code>"s.  "<code>char *</code>" is C's way of handling character strings,
which are represented as arrays of characters where the last character is
ASCII character 0 (often written as <code>'\0'</code>).  This will make more
sense when we have discussed pointers in a couple of weeks. <code>argv</code>
contains one string for each of the command line arguments that your program
is run with.  More on this below.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>To give an example of this, let's take the command line from the example
above:</p>

<pre>    % sorter 5 9 -2 150 -95 23 2 5 80
</pre>

<p>This would produce the following values in <code>argc</code> and
<code>argv</code>:</p>

<pre>    argc        10
    argv[0]    "sorter"
    argv[1]    "5"
    argv[2]    "9"
    argv[3]    "-2"
    argv[4]    "150"
    argv[5]    "-95"
    argv[6]    "23"
    argv[7]    "2"
    argv[8]    "5"
    argv[9]    "80"
</pre>

<p>Note that <code>argv[0]</code> holds the name of your program, and that
the first user-supplied argument is in <code>argv[1]</code>.  <em>Remember
this!</em> (One thing this implies is that <code>argc</code> is 1 greater
than the number of user-supplied arguments.)  Notice also that a command-line
argument of "5" is <b>not</b> an integer; it's a string that can be converted
into an integer.  Which leads us to...</p>

<h3>Converting strings to integers</h3>

<p>Okay, so how do we turn these argv strings into integer values?  Well,
there's this handy function called <code>atoi</code> ("<b>a</b>scii <b>to</b>
<b>i</b>nteger").  For example, <code>atoi("5")</code> equals 5.  In order to use
<code>atoi</code>, you need to put the following line at the top of your
program:</p>

<pre>    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</pre>

<p><code>atoi</code> is a pretty dumb function; if you pass it a bogus value
it'll just return 0 instead of signalling any kind of error.  That means that
you need to check for the optional command-line arguments "<code>-b</code>"
and "<code>-q</code>" before trying to convert a command-line argument to an
<code>int</code>.

</p><h3>The minimum element sort algorithm</h3>

<p>Alright, so what is this "minimum element sort" algorithm?  The basic idea is
that the smallest element in the array will be the zeroth element in the
sorted array, the second-smallest will be the first element, etc.  Here's how
it works:</p>

<p>Let <code>array</code> be the array of integers, and <code>num_elements</code> be
the total number of elements in <code>array</code>.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Start with <code>start = 0</code> (for the index of the zeroth
element).</p></li>

<li><p>Set <code>smallest = start</code> (smallest stores the index of the
smallest element encountered so far).</p></li>

<li><p>Run through a loop with the variable <code>index</code> going from
    <code>start</code> to <code>num_elements</code></p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>If <code>array[index] &lt; array[smallest]</code>, set &nbsp; 
  <code>smallest = index</code>.</p></li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><p>Once the loop ends, swap <code>array[start]</code> and <code>array[smallest]</code>
(moving the smallest element found to the beginning of the array you
searched).</p>
</li>

<li><p> 
Increment <code>start</code>, and if <code>start &lt; num_elements</code>, go back to
step 2.  <b>Do not</b> use a <code>goto</code> statement, however; use another
loop.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If <code>start &gt;= num_elements</code> then you're done and the array is
sorted.
</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>Adding command-line options</h3>

<p>You will add the ability to process two optional command-line arguments
(usually called "command-line options") to your program.  These options will
be <code>-b</code> and <code>-q</code>.  To test for these, you'll need to be
able to compare strings.  The function <code>strcmp(str1, str2)</code>
returns <code>0</code> if <code>str1</code> and <code>str2</code> are the
<i>same</i> and nonzero otherwise.  So to check if the first argument is
<code>-b</code>, you would have to do something like:</p>

<pre>    if (strcmp(argv[1],"-b") == 0)
    {
         /* put stuff here */
    }
</pre>

<p>To use the <code>strcmp</code> function, you need to put the following
line with the other <code>#include</code>s at the top of your file:</p>

<pre>    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>WARNING!</b> Do <b>not</b> do this:</p>

<pre>    if (argv[1] == "-b")  /* WRONG! */
    {
         /* put stuff here */
    }
</pre>

<p>This doesn't work; you can't compare strings using the <code>==</code>
operator.  The reason for this will be made clear when we talk about
pointers.</p>

<p>You should add information on any command-line options you allow to the
usage information that is printed out when there are no arguments.
<b>NOTE</b>: As mentioned above, now would be a really good time to read <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/cmdline_args.html">this page</a> on how to handle command-line
arguments and optional arguments.  You are required to abide by these
conventions for this and all future assignments; if you don't, we will
make you redo the assignment.</p>

<p>If the user supplies one of the command-line options, you must <i>not</i>
treat it as part of the list of integers.  Also, <b>you must <i>not</i>
assume that the command-line options are going to be entered before the
numbers</b>; it should be possible to enter them anywhere after the program
name (and the test script will check for this).  Finally, <b>it's legal to
enter the command-line options more than once</b>, although this won't make
any difference after the first time.  <b>You don't need complicated code to
achieve this!</b> You can process all of the command-line arguments in a
single pass through the <code>argv</code> array.  Many students write
absurdly complicated code to handle the command-line arguments, and it's just
a waste of effort.  In other words, it's much easier than you probably think
it is.</p>

<p>One thing you <b>do</b> have to make sure of is that you aren't adding
values into the array of numbers at indices that are too large.  This array
can only be 32 elements long at most, so if you try to assign to indices 32
or greater, it's an error even if it seems to work properly.  <b>NOTE</b>: It
should be clear why indices greater than 32 are off-limits, but why do you
think it's illegal to assign to index 32 exactly?</p>

<p>To keep things simple, you are only required to handle integers or the two
specific command-line options <code>-b</code> and <code>-q</code>, and any
command-line argument (not counting the program name) that isn't
<code>-b</code> or <code>-q</code> can be assumed to be an integer.</p>

<p>Here are the command-line options and what they mean:</p>

<ul>

<li><p> The "<code>-b</code>" option means that you should sort using a
Bubble Sort instead of a Minimal Element Sort algorithm.</p>

<p>Bubble Sort, like Minimal Element Sort, is not a very efficient algorithm.
Much more efficient algorithms (such as Quicksort) exist, but they are best
left until after you've had some experience with recursion, which is coming
up next lesson :-) Also, the C standard library has a <code>qsort</code>
(Quicksort) library function, but to use it you need to understand function
pointers, which we won't cover in this track (although it's not that hard).
</p></li>

<li><p> The "<code>-q</code>" option suppresses the output (<i>i.e.</i>
nothing gets printed).  Why would we want to do this?  See the next section.
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Information on different sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, can be
found all over the web, in algorithms textbooks, written on bathroom walls,
scrawled on fortune cookies, etc. etc.</p>

<h3>More on command-line options</h3>

<p>Here are some guidelines (which we expect you to follow) for implementing
the command-line option processing in this program.  They will make it much
easier to get a working program that passes the test script.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>First off, do not change the elements in the <code>argv</code> array
at all!  There is no need to.  Some people try to shuffle values in the
<code>argv</code> array, as if you need to pass <code>argv</code> to the
sorting functions.  You don't.  What you need to do is to create a brand new
array that can hold all the numbers in the <code>argv</code> array.  Altering
the <code>argv</code> array is legal, but it's poor programming
style.</p></li>

<li><p>Second, this new array has to be large enough to hold all the numbers
on the command line, and no larger.  Given what you all know now, this means
that it should be 32 elements long.  You may not use all of them (that's
fine), but they will be there in case someone enters a command line with 32
numbers. Later, I'll show you how to create arrays that have exactly the
right number of elements, based on the input.  Also, you aren't allowed to do
this:</p>

<pre>    int n = 10;
    int array[n];  <b>/* Invalid */</b>
</pre>

<p>This isn't legal C, so if you do this, you'll get a compiler warning, and
my policy is to not allow programs that generate compiler warnings.  In
addition, you can't just use a humongous array, like this:</p>

<pre>    int array[1000];
</pre>

<p>This kind of thing is just programming to make the test script work,
usually for the wrong reason.  So 32 is as big an array as I'll allow.</p>

</li>

<li><p>Third, you have to check if there are <b>more</b> than 32 numbers in
the command line, which means 32 values that are neither the program name
(<code>argv[0]</code>) nor <code>-b</code> nor <code>-q</code>.  If there are
more than 32 numbers, the program should exit with a usage message and return
a non-zero value from <code>main()</code>.  The test script will check for
this.  In addition, make sure that your program doesn't at any point add an
element to the numbers array at an invalid index <i>i.e.</i> an index larger
than 31.  Even if the program passes the test script, this is a serious
error, because you're writing into memory that isn't part of the
array.</p></li>

<li><p>Fourth, the <code>-q</code> or <code>-b</code> arguments can occur
_anywhere_ on the command line except in <code>argv[0]</code> (you should
know why they can't occur in <code>argv[0]</code>), and there can even be
more than one <code>-b</code> or <code>-q</code> arguments in the command
line.  Multiple <code>-b</code> or <code>-q</code> arguments don't do
anything beyond what single ones do.  The test script checks for this
too.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, despite all these guidelines, this is actually a pretty easy
problem; you can do everything in a single <code>for</code> loop.  If your
solution is very complicated, you are almost certainly doing something
wrong.</p></li>


</ul>

<h3>Avoiding magic numbers</h3>

<p>A "magic number" is a number that is just plopped into a program with no
context, and especially a number like this that is repeated several times in
a program.  In this lab, the number "32" hard-coded into the program would be
a magic number.  Magic numbers are almost always bad, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>

<li>They tell the reader nothing about why this number is this value.</li>

<li>If you decide to change it to a different value, you have to change it
in multiple places, and it's easy to forget one, leading to hard-to-find
bugs.</li>

</ol>

<p>It's extremely easy to avoid using magic numbers; just use the
<code>#define</code> preprocessor instruction to define a meaningful symbolic
name for the magic number, and <b>only</b> use the symbolic name in the
program.  That way, if you want to change the number's value, you only have
to do it in one place (by changing the <code>#define</code> statement).</p>

<p>We will take marks off for using magic numbers in this lab and in all
subsequent labs, so make sure you don't use them.  <b>Specifically, the
number "32" should only occur <u>once</u> in your entire program, inside a
<code>#define</code> statement!</b></p>


<h3>Commenting</h3>

<p><b>Don't forget to write good comments!</b> From now on, we'll expect your
commenting to be top-notch, unless (as in some later labs) we supply you with
a code template that already has the comments (in which case we'll expect
that you've read and understood the comments, and that your code is
consistent with them).</p>

<p>Specifically, we want to see:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>A comment at the top of the source code file explaining what the
program does.</p></li>

<li><p>A comment before each function (except for <code>main</code>) which
explains what the function does, what its arguments mean, and what its return
value represents (if it has a return value).</p></li>

<li><p>Comments inside functions explaining how the code works, unless it's
totally obvious.  For this lab, for instance, you'll want to explain how your
sorting functions work.  It's better to put this inside the function than
before the function, because knowledge of how it works isn't usually
important for using the function (<i>i.e.</i> it's not part of the function's
interface, just its implementation).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You may think this is too much work; it isn't.   The amount of time it
takes you to write good comments is usually only a fraction of the time it
takes you to write good code.  In fact, many programmers advocate writing
comments <b>before</b> writing code; the comments then serve as a kind of
"scaffolding" around which you build your program.  Writing the comments
first forces you to think clearly about what you want to achieve, instead of
just randomly writing code and stopping when it seems to work.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Testing your program</h2>

<p>Many programmers can write working code, but few programmers test their
code systematically to see if it actually does work.  It is important to
learn different strategies for doing this, because it can not only improve
the quality of your code, but also the quality of your life.  If you don't
believe me, that's because you haven't spent enough four-hour+ sessions
trying to track down a single bug caused by a typo somewhere in your program.
Don't laugh; it happens all the time, and it happens more with C than with
any other computer language (except maybe C++).  What we want to do here is
see how we can make it happen less often.</p>

<h3>The joy of <code>assert</code></h3>

<p>Using <code>assert</code> is probably the single easiest way to improve
the quality of your code, and one of the least used.  The idea behind
<code>assert</code> is to make your program <i>self-checking</i>.  Let's say
you've just coded up an incredibly hairy algorithm which will balance the
budget, cure cancer, send mankind to the stars and do other wonderful things.
How do you know that your code doesn't have a bug?  And if it does have a
bug, how do you find it?</p>

<p>Well, there are probably points in your program where you expect certain
things to be true.  For instance, in the sorting program described above,
after you've completed the sort, you expect that the array of integers is, in
fact, sorted.  If you could check this right after you did the sort, then if
your sorting algorithm ever fails on any input, you will know about it right
away.  <code>assert</code> makes this easy.  Using <code>assert</code> looks
like this:</p>

<pre>    int i;

    /* your algorithm goes here... */

    assert(i == 10);  /* assert that the integer variable i is equal to 10. */
</pre>

<p>In the above case, if the program reaches the <code>assert</code>
statement and <code>i</code> is equal to 10, the program continues on
executing; the <code>assert</code> statement has no effect.  However, if
<code>i</code> is not equal to 10, the program aborts (exits), telling you
the exact line in the file where the error occurred.  "Whoa!", you're
probably saying, "that's a bit extreme, isn't it?"  Well, the point is to use
<code>assert</code> for situations where you <i>know</i> something has to be
true assuming that your algorithm is correct.  If it isn't true, your program
has failed, and all bets are off.  (In actual fact, it's fairly easy to write
custom versions of <code>assert</code> that don't abort but just print a
nasty message and continue.)  The <code>assert</code> statement is referred
to as an <i>assertion</i>, logically enough.</p>

<p>You might also be asking: why don't I just write this:</p>

<pre>    int i;

    /* your algorithm goes here... */

    if (i != 10)
    {
        abort();  /* or exit(), or some similar function */
    }
</pre>

<p>instead of using that <code>assert</code> function?  Well, aside from the fact
that <code>assert</code> is more concise, and that <code>assert</code> prints out
line numbers where the assertion failed, the big advantage of assertions is
that they can be <i>switched off</i>.  Even though assertions don't usually
slow your code down appreciably, there is some cost, which goes up the more
assertions you use.  Let's say you've used assertions to debug your code, and
you reach a point where you are highly confident that your algorithm is
correct.  At this point you may want your algorithm to run as fast as
possible, and not waste time checking assertions that you are sure will
always be true.  In other words, you want to leave the assertions out in the
compiled code, but you don't want to remove the lines with the
<code>assert</code> statements in them in case you modify the code later and need
to debug it again.</p>

<p>It turns out that by adding the magic word <b><code>-DNDEBUG</code></b> as
an argument to <code>gcc</code> when you compile the C code, the assertions
will be removed from the code before compilation, so your code will run at
maximum speed.</p>


<h3>Using <code>assert</code> in your program</h3>

<p>To use <code>assert</code>, make sure you add this to the top of your file:</p>

<pre>    #include &lt;assert.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>In your sort function(s), write this right at the end of the function:</p>

<pre>    /* Check that the array is sorted correctly. */

    for (i = 1; i &lt; num_elements; i++)
    {
        assert(array[i] &gt;= array[i-1]);
    }
</pre>

<p>where <code>num_elements</code> is the number of elements in the array and
<code>array</code> is the name of the array.  Notice that here we're putting
the <code>assert</code> statement in a loop.  This bit of code is technically
called a <i>postcondition</i>; a postcondition is what is required to be true
after a function has completed.  Some computer languages, such as Eiffel,
have very sophisticated systems for checking postconditions (as well as
<i>preconditions</i> and various kinds of <i>invariants</i>); these languages
make it easier to write correct code than C does.  Here, the postcondition
will cause an assertion failure if the array isn't sorted at the end of the
sorting function, which is what we want.</p>

<p>Notice how the postcondition is just three lines of trivial code, as
compared to the sort routines themselves, which will probably be considerably
longer.  This illustrates the general principle that it's much easier to
check if something is right than to make it right in the first place.
Assertions are easy to write; use them!</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: It may seem wasteful to write the same assertion code at the
end of both sorting functions, but that's where I want you to write it, and
not <i>e.g.</i> in the <code>main()</code> function.  That's because you will
eventually be writing larger programs which span many files, and functions
you write will be used outside of the file they are written in.  It's
important for functions to be self-contained as much as possible, and if the
assertion checking is built in to a sorting function, then anyone using that
function will automatically get the benefit of the assertion checking.</p>


<h3>Running the test script</h3>

<p>Now you get to know why you added the <code>-q</code> option to your
program.  The reason for the <code>-q</code> option is to make the program
only print output if the assertion fails.  We can use this to write a test
script to check the program.</p>

<p>We are supplying you with a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab3/Makefile">Makefile</a> and a <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab3/run_test">test script</a> for your program.  The test script is
written in a computer language called <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a>.  Python is a scripting language
which is excellent for many tasks, one of them being writing test scripts.
Python is available on most Linux systems, including on all of the CS cluster
machines.  What you should do is to download the test script into the same
directory that your lab 3 C code is located in.  Use the "save page as"
feature of your browser; don't try to cut and paste the code into a text
editor, because the odds are 100-to-1 that it won't work properly.  When the
file is in the correct location, make it executable by typing:</p>

<pre>% chmod +x run_test</pre>

<p>where <code>%</code> is the terminal prompt.</p>

<p>What the test script does is to generate a series of random inputs
to the program and run the program with the <code>-q</code> option.  The test
script is invoked by typing</p>

<pre>% make test</pre>

<p>at the terminal prompt.  The test script will tell you what it's doing as
it proceeds.  If your sort routines ever fail, you will see the output of
<code>assert</code>, telling you what line the failure occurred at.  The test
script will run the program using the Minimal Insertion Sort as well as the
Bubble Sort.  If something else goes wrong (<i>e.g.</i> your command-line
processing is faulty, or a core dump occurs), the test script will report an
error, along with the program invocation that caused it.  It will not tell
you exactly what error occurred, but by re-running the erroneous invocation
(by cutting and pasting into your terminal window) you should be able to
figure it out yourself.  If all goes well, the test script will report
success.</p>

<p>Note that if there is a bug in your assertion code itself, all bets are off.
However, as mentioned above, writing correct assertions is pretty trivial
(especially since we've done it for you :-)).</p>

<h2>Supporting files</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab3/Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, be sure that all the command lines in the Makefile start with
tabs, or they will not work.</p></li>

<li><p>
The <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/lab3/run_test">test script</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, in order to get this to work, you have to do</p>

<pre>% chmod +x run_test
</pre>

<p>after downloading this file, in order to make it executable.  From now on,
we'll assume you'll remember this (and the Makefile tab rule above) for
future assignments.
</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/c_style_check">style checker</a>.  To invoke the
style checker you can just type</p>

<pre>% make check
</pre>

<p>at the prompt (assuming that the Makefile is in the same
directory).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Again, remember to read <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/cmdline_args.html">this page</a>
for more information on how to handle command-line arguments effectively.</p>
