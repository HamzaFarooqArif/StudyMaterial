  <h3 class="Times_New_Roman">Ancient Peshawar</h3>
  <blockquote>Peshawar was known in Sanskrit as Puru?apura, literally meaning "city of men".[a] It also found mention in the Zend Avesta as Vaek?r?ta, the seventh most beautiful place on earth created by Ahura Mazda It was known as the "crown jewel" of Bactria and also held sway over Takshashila (modern Taxila).[7] Being among the most ancient cities of the region between Central and South Asia, Peshawar has for centuries been a center of trade between Bactria, South Asia and Central Asia. As an ancient center of learning, the 2nd century BC. Bakhshali Manuscript used in the Bakhshali approximation was found nearby.
  Vedic mythology refers to an ancient settlement called Pushkalavati in the area, after Pushkal, presently known as Charsadda.[9] In recorded history, the earliest major city established in the general area of Peshawar was called Puru?apura (Sanskrit for City of Men), from which the current name "Peshawar" is likely derived and was western capital of Ghandhara civilization after Pushkalavati.The area that Peshawar occupies was then seized by the Greco-Bactrian king, Eucratides (170 – 159 BC), and was controlled by a series of Greco-Bactrian, and later, Indo-Greek kings, who ruled an empire that geographically spanned from the area of present-day Afghanistan to North India. Later, the city was ruled by several Parthian and Indo-Parthian kings, another group of Iranian peoples germane to the region, the most famous of whom, Gondophares, ruled the city and its environs, starting in circa AD 46; the period of rule by Gondophares was briefly followed by two or three of his descendants, before they were displaced   by the first of the "Great Kushans", Kujula Kadphises, around the middle of the 1st century AD.According to the historian, Tertius Chandler, Peshawar consisted of a population of 120,000 in the year AD 100, making it a major city and the seventh-most populous city in the world at the time.
