  <h1 class="Times_New_Roman">Lahore</h1>
  <blockquote>Lahore is the capital city of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the second largest and most populous city in Pakistan, after Karachi, and the 32nd most populous urban city in the world.The city is located in the north east part of Punjab province, near the border with India. Lahore is ranked as a world city, and is one of Pakistan's wealthiest cities with an estimated total nominal GDP of $58.14 billion as of 2014.
   Lahore is the historic cultural centre of the Punjab region, and is the largest Punjabi city in the world. The city has a long history, and was once under the rule of the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Lodis, Marathas and the Delhi Sultanate. Lahore reached the height of its splendour under the Mughal Empire, serving as its capital city for a number of years. The city then became capital of the Sikh Empire, before becoming the capital of the Punjab under British rule.Lahore was central to the independence movements of both India and Pakistan, with the city being site of both the declaration of Indian Independence, and the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan. Following the Partition of British India, Lahore became the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.

  <h3 class="Times_New_Roman">Ancient Lahore</h3>
  <blockquote>Lahore was called by different names throughout history. To date there is no conclusive evidence as to when it was founded. Some historians trace the history of the city as far back as 4000 years ago. Ptolemy, the celebrated 2nd-century Egyptian astronomer and geographer, mentions in his Geographia a city called Labokla situated on the route east of the Indus River, in a region described as extending along the Jhelum, Chenab, and Ravi rivers which may have been in reference to the ancient settlement of Lahore.
  The earliest recorded definitive mention of Lahore was written by the Chinese pilgrim Hieun-tsang, who gave a vivid description of Lahore when he visited the city in 630 C.E. The oldest authentic surviving document about Lahore is the Hudud al-'Alam (The Regions of the World), written in 982 C.E. in which Lahore is mentioned as a town invaded by Arab invaders that had "impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards.
