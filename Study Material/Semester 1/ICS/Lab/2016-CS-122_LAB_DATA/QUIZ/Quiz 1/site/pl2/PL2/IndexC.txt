A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming, serving as a way of building the structure and elements of computer programs. Capabilities and styles of various programming languages are defined by their supported programming paradigms; some programming languages are designed to follow only one paradigm, while others support multiple paradigms.

Programming paradigms that are often distinguished include imperative, declarative, functional, object-oriented, procedural, logic and symbolic programming. With different paradigms, programs can be seen and built in different ways; for example, in object-oriented programming, a program is a collection of objects interacting in explicitly defined ways, while in declarative programming the computer is told only what the problem is, not how to actually solve it.
