   <h1>Geography of Pakistan</h1>
  </center>
  <p>
  Pakistan has a long history with archaeological remains dating back to over 4,000 years ago. In 362 B.C.E., part of Alexander the Great's empire occupied what is present-day Pakistan. In the 8th century, Muslim traders arrived in Pakistan and began to introduce the Muslim religion to the area.
  Pakistan is bordered by Afghanistan and Iran to the west while People’s Republic of China borders the country in the north and India to east.
  The geography of Pakistan is a profound blend of landscapes varying from plains to deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the Arabian Sea in the south to the mountains of the Karakoram range in the north.
  Pakistan, officially called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is located in the Middle East near the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. It is bordered by Afghanistan, Iran, India and China. Pakistan is also very close to Tajikistan but the two countries are separated by the Wakhan Corridor in Afghanistan. The country is known as having the sixth largest population in the world and the second largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia.
