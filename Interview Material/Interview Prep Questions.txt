1. FIND THE WORD THAT IS MOST REPEATED IN A STRING ARRAY IN O(N).
2. Given an array like 1,2,3,5,8, and a number n, find all such combinations whose sum is equal to n. like lets say n = 10,
then 2,8   3,7 3,5,2    2,3,5 and etc.
3. y =  sin(x) + x^2, write function to find the area under curve given by this function.
