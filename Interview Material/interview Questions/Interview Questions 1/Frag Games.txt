2 string problem
8 balls problem
output of program
int main()
{
int a=3;
if(a=7)
cout<< a;
if(a=2)
cout<<a;
else{
cout<<a
}
if(a=0){
cout<<a;
}
cout<<a; 
}

output:
int a[3][2][2]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}; cout<< a[2][1][0];???
output:
class A
{
void print(){cout<<"A"<<endl}
}
class B:public A
{
int print(){cout<<"B"<<endl;}// other question is " static void print(){cout<<"B"<<endl;}
}
int main(){
A obj=new A();
B obj2=new B();
A obj3=new B();
obj->print();obj2->print();obj3->print();
}

how we resolve the diamond problem in c++

there is array of integers find first two number whos sum = 10 in O (n^2) and O(n)

what is inheritance polymorphism interface abstract classes

types of classes and their differences.

in interface all functions are pure virtual but in abstract classes we can make all functions pure virtaul also.. so why there is need of interface.
Question:
make a function which calculate power of a number in O(lgn)

- there is a matrix of any size 
assume 3X3
1 0 0
0 0 0
2 0 0
from '2' to '1' there are many paths you can not visit through diagonals and 1 and 2 can be any where in nXn matrix
find the minimum steps required from 1 to 2
in this case minimum step '2' 2-> 0 , 0 -> 1 , maximum can be 6 .

there are two trees check whether they are mirror image of each others or not

check string in palindrom using recursion
find the height of the tree?
longest common substring of two strings?

check whether there is a loop in Link List if yes then remove it ..
