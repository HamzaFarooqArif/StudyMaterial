-2nd max in array
-ERD
-Binary search tree kth maximum
-reverse words in string
-sort elements in array with O(n) => count sort

-2nd max salary from DB
-find count of marks=70 from db     select count(marks) from student where marks=70
-deletion in link list
-find the missing number from the series[1-15]
-x^y by recursion

-The primary key from table A is forigin key in table B & the data in table A is deleted then find those rows from table B which are not present in table A.write a query
-arange the cubes in 10  x 10 arrangement then find te no of cubes which you have seen at surfaces?
-you have 8 balls in which 1 ball is weighted heavy but visually they all are same search that one ball which are heavy in minimum iteration?


Sorting using Insertion Sort Algorithm

int a[6] = {5, 1, 6, 2, 4, 3};
int i, j, key;
for(i=1; i<6; i++)
{
  key = a[i];
  j = i-1;
  while(j>=0 && key < a[j])
  {
    a[j+1] = a[j];
    j--;
  }
  a[j+1] = key;
}

Worst Case Time Complexity : O(n2)

Best Case Time Complexity : O(n)

Average Time Complexity : O(n2)

Space Complexity : O(1)
